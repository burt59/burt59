How to earn&nbsp;&nbsp;$3000 a month</h2>
<br>
There are some tips and tricks of how<b>to earn</b> enough money at PTC sites ,and the majority&nbsp; don't believe that one can earn enough money with the help of PTC sites, myself&nbsp; I thought that it would be impossible to earn a significant income through<b><span style="font-size: large;"> <a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php? ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PTC sites</a></span></b>.I had no tactics&nbsp; to commit to these types of <b>PTC sites&nbsp;</b>like&nbsp;<a href="http://ick. li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span>&nbsp;</b></u><br>

Every member once registered with PTC sites should read this entire guide as it is developed, as it contains solutions for most of the common problems that "buxers" face. <br>
<br>
Part 1: Getting Started: <br>
<br>
<h3>
<u><b>What is&nbsp;</b></u><u style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">wad ojooo</span></b></u><b>? </b></u></h3>
<br>
<br>
<u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u>&nbsp;is a PTC (paid to click ads where members earn a small amount of money for ads that have clicked and viewed. <br>
<br>
<u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span>&nbsp;</b></u>&nbsp;is 100% legitimate and reliable is perhaps the number one among the PTC sites that are on the internet. <br>
<br>
Advertisers on<a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad. ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span>&nbsp;</b></u>&nbsp;are fully aware that members are paid to post ads, so it is a fair system for all.<br>

<br>
<br>
There are three basic income streams on<span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u><br>
Part 2: The first two weeks: ( Goal 1 to complete). <br>
. <br>
In my opinion, the first two weeks are <span style="color: red;"><u><b>"make or break"</b></u></span>with members<a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad. ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u><br>
<br>
Unfortunately, lack of patience and will many members leave<a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php? ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u>&nbsp;very quickly, but you're in the right place to avoid missing this opportunity or leaving<a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad. ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u><br>
<br>
<br>
- Income from your personal actions on the site (posting ads, doing mini-jobs, etc)<br>
<br>
- Commissions&nbsp; from RRs (rented referrals) paid to you&nbsp; to be explained later in part 3.<br>
<br>
- Commissions paid from DRS (direct referrals)to you&nbsp; - explained later in Part4. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
<u><b><span style="color: #6aa84f;">How much can I do? </span></b></u></h3>
<br>
If you are willing to put in a little time each day, and if you follow this guide, you should be able to make well over $3000 a month by spending less than 20 minutes each day. <br>
<br>
Some users make several thousand dollars a month with the same time commitment. It won't happen overnight, but with some diligence, it's certainly an achievable goal already reached by many former members&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo. com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u><br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
</div>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f; font-size: large;"><u><b>How do I get started? </b></u></span></h3>
<br>
<br>
If you don't already have an account on&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad. ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u>, <a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Click this link</a> to get an account<br>
<br>
If you have 200 DR direct referrals , but they are not good on&nbsp;<a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php? ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u>, you won't be able to make any money from those 200 DR direct referrals because they are lazy! <br>
<br>
My goal is to help you acquire referrals&nbsp; rented on<span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u> who are active all the time so you can make more money. <br>
<br>
As a rule,even these referrers work like you to earn money ,of which you will earn 50% of their earnings so they will always&nbsp; active! <br>
<br>
<br>
Once you are registered ,if you are not yet registered<span style="font-size: large;"><b> </b></span><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>it is here</b></span> </a>,and once done it is to&nbsp; continue with part 2. <br>
<br>
During the first 15 days you are not eligible for future projects, you should not focus on that. Your only focus should be: <br>
<br>
- Getting into the daily routine and clicking on the ads assigned to you. <br>
<br>
- Earn your first $0.60 so you can begin the process of renting referrals. <br>
<br>
It is essential that you post every ad that is assigned to you during this period so that you can remove the limits from your account and be eligible for future projects as soon as possible. You must be a member for 15 days and 100 ad displays to remove the limit. <br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f; font-size: large;">ASTUCE: </span></h3>
<br>
View ads by logging in and clicking on "View Ads" button at the top of the page. <br>
<br>
You won't earn much for the first couple of weeks, it's a decision and patience take. <br>
<br>
15 days x approx. $0.04/day = $0.60...that may sound disgusting ,but it is patience that will make you earn $3000 a month so $0.60 is your first goal. <br>
<br>
<br>
Goal 1 - Earn $0.60. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f; font-size: large;">TIP: </span></h3>
<br>
If you are able to complete the mini-jobs, you can reach the goal in a day or two! <br>
<br>
If you are interested in starting to earn faster ,it is worth just a little money to invest in your new business<span style="font-size: large;"><b> wad ojooo</b></span>, there are instructions in part 3.<br>
<br>
However, it takes&nbsp; 15 days before you are eligible for future projects again (you guessed it) by 15 days. <br>
<br>
<br>
Part 3: the rental of your First Sponsorships&nbsp;&nbsp; goals 3 to complete). <br>
<br>
Congratulations, you are now just a preschool graduate! It's a big deal to make it through the first 15 days. Many people quit before they reach that point...and guess what, that's when the fun begins! Any handsome man who is passionate will get<br>
to the goal <br>
And it's worth patience and patience all money that is earned requires patience and preserverance <br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f;">
You're going to do just as well for the rest! </span></h3>
<br>
Once you have at least $0.60 in your account<span style="font-size: large;"><b>&nbsp;</b></span><b style="font-size: x-large;">wad ojooo</b>&nbsp;(even if the 15 days is not yet reached), you have enough to rent 3 referrals. As mentioned above, you can "jumpstart" your business by investing a few dollars if you have enough money and start renting referrals&nbsp;<b style="font-size: x-large;">wad ojooo</b>&nbsp;earlier. <br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="font-size: large;">Before you read this: </span></h3>
<br>
If you click on at least 4 ads being a standard member or if you click on at least 9 ads being a golden member, you will receive all clicks made&nbsp; by your referrals, direct or rented referrals." <br>
<br>
TIP: The required ads are the "fixed ads" [colored Yellow] ... Although you should always check out every available ad anyway. <br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img src="https://wad.ojooo.com/bs_c.php?lng=fr&u=2244364" align="middle"></a></div>
<br>
Goal 2<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- Rent 3 referrals by clicking on the "Rent Refferal" on your account homepage. <br>
. <br>
Goal 3 <br>
<br>
- Activate "Autopay" always in the table of rented referrals-&gt; Referral menu. <br>
<br>
<br>
"Rented godchildren" cost $ 0.20 for a month. Instead of paying each time, they will get paid for themselves as long as autopay is activated. You get a 15% discount for each referral, but they will be your referral as long as they are active. As standard, you get $0.005 per click from each RR. <br>
<br>
I prefer Autopay enabled because every day your<b> referrals are active</b>, they pay for themselves to be dipped. This way you don't need to worry about how much money you need to book to keep your rentals. Autopay is an ideal not to worry about your referrals it extends only those of <b>active and automatic referrals</b>! <br>
. <br>
<h3>
TIP: There is a 15% discount if you activate Autopay&nbsp; you will earn the following: </h3>
- <br>
- 3 RRs x 4 Click RRs at $0.005 each = $0.06/day. <br>
- plus your clicks on the ads assigned to you, still about $0.04 / day. <br>
- For a total of $ 0.10 / day that: <br>
<br>
- In a week you can rented three more referrals, and earn $ 0.16 / day. <br>
- The following week you will have enough to rent 3 more referrals (now you will have 9 referrals) for a total of $ 0.18 / day. <br>
<br>
-The next week you will have enough to rent 3 more referrals (now you will have 12 referrals) for a total of $ 0.24 / day. <br>
- At the end of the fourth week you will have enough to rent 10 more referrals (now you will have 22 referrals) for a total of $ 0.44 / day. <br>
And so on... <br>
 <br>
<h3>
"Here is proof that so far the Guide will only tell the truth!" </h3>
<br>
<u><b>TIP: </b></u><br>
<br>
If a rented referral is inactive for 14 days, it will be replaced with a new one for free and automatically! <br>
<br>
Continue to see your affected ads every day so you can earn your rented referral income, and when you have enough money to rent more referrals, you have to do them! Rented more referrals, the more money you will make. I recommend choosing a day of the week to rent, and have as much funds in your wad ojooo account to rent. <br>
<br>
Goal 4 <br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f; font-size: large;"><u><b>Continue to acquire 200 rented referrals. </b></u></span></h3>
<br>
Yes, this will take some time, but remember, you are building a business with passive income with just a small investment of time each day! It goes very fast as foreclosure increases your income, and increased income allows you to rent more&nbsp; rented referrals. <br>
. <br>
TIP: 200 RR * 4 RR Clicks at $0.005 per click = $4/day ... It will take about 20 days to save up to $80 for part 4. <br>
. <br>
Goal 5:<br>
<br>
Once you have 200 referrals, STOP renting and save up to $80 in your Probux account.Will be explained in part 4.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Part 4: <br>
<br>
Enjoy your profits (2 goals 2 to finish)! <br>
<br>
Now that you have 200 referrals rented, Stop renting and save up to $80 so you can upgrade your account to Golden. <br>
<br>
Once you're in Golden, you'll double your income almost instantly as you pay 2 times to10 times for your clicks and your rented referrals' clicks! <br>
<br>
Goal 6 <br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f;"><span style="font-size: large;"><u><b>&nbsp;Improve your account by&nbsp;</b></u></span><u style="font-size: x-large;"><b>premium</b></u><u style="font-size: x-large;"><b>.</b></u></span></h3>
<br>
Here you are back before you are in golden: <br>
200 RRs * 4 clicks of the RRs at $0.005 per click = $4.00 / day. (Plus DR clicks and your personal clicks). <br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f; font-size: large;"><u><b>Here's your income once&nbsp;</b></u><u><b> in premium: </b></u></span></h3>
<br>
200 RRs * 4 clicks of the RRs at $0.01 per click = $8.00 / day. (Plus DR-clicks and your personal clicks). <br>
<br>
Once you have passed in Golden, start renting again the referrals.<br>
<br>
It is so much to cash your money earn, but you really need to get the maximum number of RR and DR(rented referrals and direct referrals) so that you earn as much as possible. <br>
<br>
Goal 7 <br>
<br>
<u><b>- Build your leased referrals to 2000. </b></u><br>
<br>
Resume your rental process and acquire 2,000 rented referrals. It won't be terrible, already for a long time now you should be making over $200 a month. <br>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: red; font-size: x-large;"><b>2000 rented referrals x 4clicks from RRs at $0.01 = $80/day (plus your DRs and clicks). </b></span></h3>
<br>
TIP:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;When you go golden, you will have to see 9 ads per day instead of 4! <br>
<br>
At this point, you are a true master of <span style="font-size: large;"><b>wad ojooo</b></span><br>
Goal 8 <br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;upgrade your account to VIP. </span></h3>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img src="https://wad.ojooo.com/bs_c.php?lng=fr&u=2244364" align="middle"></a></div>
<br>
Goal 9 <br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><u><b>- Build your 4000 referrals is to rent more and more to earn more. </b></u></span></h3>
<br>
Once you have $790 in your <a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ProBux</a> account, use and upgrade your account to "Ultimate" for one year, so you can have 4000 rented referrals, and earn more benefits. <br>
<br>
4000 rented referrals * 4 clicks of rented referrals at $0.01 = $160 / day (plus DR clicks and your personal clicks / tasks). <br>
&nbsp;<span style="color: red;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>$160 * 30 days = $4800 / Month </b></span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f; font-size: large;"><u><b>Mathematics is not magic. </b></u></span></h3>
<br>
Mathematically speaking, the formulas used by&nbsp;<a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php? ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u>&nbsp;are set up for success, if you are committed to your own success. It is not difficult, but it does require more diligence. Math doesn't lie, and there is no magic.The numbers speak for themselves. <br>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f; font-size: large;"><u><b>The promises and guarantees. </b></u></span></h3>
<br>
Life is full of people who will say anything to get what they want. <br>
<br>
<u><b>Watch out for those people! </b></u><br>
<br>
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php? ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u><a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH">&nbsp;</a>is not a get-rich-quick program, but you can certainly earn a significant additional income if treated as a business.<br>
<br>
The examples used in this guide are accurate, but you must understand that all your RRs will give you 4 clicks every day. Some will give you more, some will give you less.<br>
<br>
So in that sense, the examples are accurate, the experience varies a bit. Obviously, I can't promise you wealth, but I can guarantee that you're going to make money with<a href="http://ick.li/QyVqeH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo. com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></span><u><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://wad.ojooo.com/register.php?ref=dolphar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wad ojooo</a></span></b></u>&nbsp;if you follow this guide! <br>
<span style="color: #6aa84f;"><br></span>
<br>
<h3>
<span style="color: #6aa84f; font-size: large;"><u><b>To recycle or not to recycle? </b></u></span></h3>
<br>
<br>
Recycling inactive RRs is an option, but personally, I feel manual recycling is not profitable at first, when the self-recycling system for free. Once you have enough income, recycling manually can be beneficial. <br>
